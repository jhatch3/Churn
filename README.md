This repo holds my final project for CS 472/572 for the Spring 2025 term, where I evaluate different models at predicting churn. The repo contains 16 files including this READ ME.

1) Machine Learning Report - CS472 - Justin - Hatch - S25 - F.pdf

  This is my overall report where I explain my project, the background, experiments, and results.
  
2) main.ipynb
   
  This is where most of the preprocessing happened. This includes data cleaning, feature selection and saving into csv file

3) decision_tree.ipynb

  This is where the decision tree model was implemented and tuned. The F1 score was also included with some graphs.

4) knn.ipynb
5) svm.ipynb
